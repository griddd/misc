I occasionally have trouble with dotdotpwn reporting false positives when doing a web application security test.  Below is a process I use
to verify/validate what dotdotpwn reports as a vuln.  Not real elegant, but it does the job.

First, get the output of dotdotpwn into a file.  In this case, vulns.txt.

grep autoexec.bat vulns.txt > vulns_autoexec.txt (pull out all lines with word autoexec.bat)

cut -d ' ' -f 4 vulns_autoexec.txt > rough.txt (get only lines with valid http request)

sed 's/^/curl /' rough.txt > new_rough.txt (add curl command to each http request)

sed 's/$/ >> here.txt/' new_rough.txt > now.txt (append >> here.txt to each line; pipe output of curl to the file now.txt)

chmod 774 now.txt (make now.txt executable)

./now.txt (run the shell script)

grep blah here.txt (look for keyword blah, which is in the autoexec.bat file, in the file here.txt)
